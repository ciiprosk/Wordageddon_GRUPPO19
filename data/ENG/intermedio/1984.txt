“Big Brother is watching you,” the caption beneath the picture ran.

The Ministry of Truth contained, it was said, three thousand rooms above ground level,
and corresponding ramifications below. Scattered about London there were just three other
buildings of similar appearance and size. So completely did they dwarf the surrounding
architecture that from the roof of Victory Mansions you could see all four of them simultaneously.
They were the homes of the four Ministries between which the entire apparatus of government was divided.
The Ministry of Truth, which concerned itself with news, entertainment, education, and the fine arts.
The Ministry of Peace, which concerned itself with war.
The Ministry of Love, which maintained law and order.
And the Ministry of Plenty, which was responsible for economic affairs.
Their names, in Newspeak: Minitrue, Minipax, Miniluv, and Miniplenty.

The Ministry of Truth was the really real one.
Its headquarters were in a huge building known simply as the Ministry,
situated in the centre of London. The Ministry was an enormous pyramidal
structure of glittering white concrete, soaring thirty stories high and resting
on a broad octagonal base. It was the place where Winston Smith worked,
rewriting history to fit the Party’s propaganda.
