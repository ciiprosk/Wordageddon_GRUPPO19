“You cannot stop me,” laughed Moros, the evil tyrant. “Now I shall use the Jewel of Power to conquer the kingdom! Drop your weapon, Eravon, or she dies.”

Moros was holding his sword against the Princess’s neck.

“The gods have truly forgotten us,” said Eravon.

A tear rolled down his cheek as he let his bow fall to the ground. There was no hope left. Moros had won.

Gabrielle let her pen fall. The final battle between Eravon and Moros was the subject of her latest fantasy novel, The Jewel of the Kingdom. Millions of Gabrielle’s fans wanted to know how the story would end. The problem was, Gabrielle didn’t know either. How could Eravon defeat such a powerful enemy?

It was late. Gabrielle looked at the page. She had to finish the chapter. The words were dancing in front of her eyes. Slowly, her head fell onto the table.

When Gabrielle woke up, she was standing in a forest, outside a castle.

“Who are you?” said someone.

The man appeared from behind the trees. He was young and handsome, and he carried a bow.

“Eravon?” said Gabrielle, in disbelief.

Gabrielle realised that, somehow, she was inside her own story. And she knew which part this was.

“Hurry!” she shouted. “Moros has captured the Princess. He’s in the castle right now, and he’s going to take the Jewel!”

“How do you know this? Are you a witch? Can you see things far away? Do you know the future?”
