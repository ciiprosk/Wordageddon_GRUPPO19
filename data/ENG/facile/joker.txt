"See, there were these two guys in a lunatic asylum... and one night, they decide they don’t like living in an asylum anymore. They decide they're going to escape!

So, like, they get up onto the roof, and there, just across this narrow gap, they see the rooftops of the town stretching away in the moonlight — stretching away to freedom.

Now, the first guy, he jumps right across no problem. But the second guy — the second guy, he’s afraid of falling. So the first guy has an idea. He says, ‘Hey! I have a flashlight with me. I’ll shine it across the gap between the buildings. You can walk across the beam and join me!’

But the second guy just shakes his head. He says... ‘What do you think I am, crazy? You’d turn it off when I was halfway across!’"
